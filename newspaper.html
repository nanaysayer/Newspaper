         <h3>STRANGERS INDEED</h3>
         <p>I cannot watch Guy Haines (Farley Granger) and Bruno Antony (Robert Walker) in Hitchcock’s Strangers on a Train (1951) without seeing them as parts of the same person. Bruno acts as Guy’s shadow, his dark half, a double. I listen closely to Bruno talking to Guy, from the first scene in the train club car to the last amidst the debris of the merry-go-round, and hear a sort of courting by Bruno, a desire to know his other, better self, his frustration of non-recognition by Guy.</p>
         <p>There are many ways to read this doubling. I prefer not to see Bruno as Guy’s evil side. Neither do I believe that Bruno’s character, in itself more interesting that Guy’s, is worth worrying about. I understand how his father-hatred and a doting mother defined his psyche. Rather, his murdering Guy’s wife benefits Guy, whereas there’s never a realistic chance that Guy will even think about killing Bruno’s father. In other words, the movie is all about Guy and Guy’s desires. Bruno is an instrument, a very willing if eccentric extension of Guy’s barely repressed desires.</p>
         <p>
         Bruno also represents the incipient phase of the celebrity stalker in our society. He follows Guy’s exploits in the society columns. He knows a lot about Guy’s life – or thinks he knows it. He knows Guy’s professional life:
         </p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    I saw you blast Faraday right off the court in South Orange season. What a backhand! Made the semi-finals, didn’t you?
                </p>
            </blockquote>
        <p>If you don’t want to see Bruno as Guy’s double or submerged self, perhaps he merely wants to be part of the famous person’s life, if not revel in it:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    It must be pretty exciting to be so important.
                </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>When Guy balks at this attention, Bruno as stalker can proceed on one course: destroying Guy’s life.</p>
            <p>Bruno acts on Guy’s behalf because he really likes Guy. One could read this as homoerotic, and rightly, given the way others, like the Senator (Leo G. Carroll), speak about Bruno as weird, an oddball, or other 1950s code to suggest his homosexuality. Bruno’s infatuation with Guy is a sexual longing. Most telling is a comment from the Senator’s daughter Barbara (Patricia Hitchcock) to her sister Anne (Ruth Roman), when there’s a discussion about Guy’s wife being killed and Guy is the prime suspect:</p>
                <blockquote>
                <p>
                   I still think it would be wonderful to have a man love you so much he’d kill for you.
                </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>She’s talking about Guy killing for Anne. But taken literally, her comment talks about a “man” who has killed for love. Bruno’s the man!</p>
            <figure>
                <img itemprop="image" src="./imges/strangers-tennis.jpg"/>
                <figcaption>Fig2. - Hitchcock, Strangers on a Train (1951).</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                Yet Bruno himself stresses Guy’s social and public standing as a center of interest. Bruno not only follows this tennis star celebrity but wants to aid the celebrity in the public sphere. Bruno becomes angry when Guy refuses to acknowledge Bruno’s actions for him. Take Bruno’s murder of Guy’s wife, Miriam (Laura Elliot), the “criss” of his crisscross murder theory. Bruno’s dumb-founded – to the point of naivete – when Guy denies ever wanting Miriam dead. If you watch the scene in the private car on the train when Bruno asks Guy if the murder theory is a good one, Guy answers “Sure, Bruno.” We, the viewers, understand what Guy means. Bruno, however, has already made up his mind to kill Miriam. He isn’t asking for Guy’s approval – his announcing the theory in itself is the approval. Guy does nothing to dissuade his other, less better half, because he does not know this part of himself. Guy, however, is not a stranger to Bruno.
            </p>
            <p>
                Maybe Bruno planned to meet Guy. This may be true but only as far as one’s double “plans” a meeting. More important is the timing of the meeting. Guy is experiencing a crisis – a showdown with his wife in Metcalf – that will get worse before the day ends. After she tells him that she’s pregnant (not by Guy), he calls Ann Morton and blurts out that he could kill Miriam. So, yes, Bruno is on the train because he’s responding to the crisis too. He has a solution that involves a moral force of sorts. Bruno cannot comprehend why Guy, or anyone, wouldn’t do what had to be done to remove the impediment to one’s egoistic bliss:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    <i>Guy:</i> You crazy maniac! Would you please get out of here and leave me alone.
                    <i>Bruno:</i> But Guy . . . I like you.
                </p>
            </blockquote>
             <p>
                 Most people come away from <i>Strangers on a Train</i> with the “crisscross” idea for a murder. Meet someone with no connection to you who also needs someone to be killed. Swap the murders. Instant alibis, absence of motives, the police are baffled. This plot device I’ve seen in several television mystery and police shows (a 77 Sunset Strip episode, and a Columbo, for starters); my interests are less melodramatic. Indeed, the swapping of murders is the film’s MacGuffin if only because there’s never a real chance of Guy killing Bruno’s father. Any crisscrossing occurs on the level of guilt transference and the real ambitions of Bruno Antony as a celebrity follower.
             </p>

            <p>
            Let’s dwell on the word “strangers” from the title. It aptly describes the relationship – inner relationship – between Guy and himself. He’s estranged from himself for no startling reason save that he’s become complacent with his life: tennis successes, his new relationship, and his prospective future in politics. The problem, and the cause of his immediate crisis, is his loveless first marriage. He does not consciously recognize how the nature of his ambitions have contributed to his personal life reaching marital critical mass. He is a man of ego, which demands that he must go forward in his career and society. From Hitchcock’s perspective, Guy’s ambition represents the normal circumstance for the American male of the mid-twentieth century. By this logic, it’s normal to trade in the first wife (a low-class slut) for a highly desirable catch, a Senator’s daughter. Miriam’s second scene, when Bruno follows her to the amusement park, instructs us, yes to her way of life, flirting with two boys (even making eyes toward Bruno and being impressed by his show of strength by ringing the bell), but also allows us to see where Guy came from, who he was before he was a celebrity. Stepping up the social ladder by marrying the Senator’s daughter is affected by Bruno killing her. Guy will become a stranger, also, to his past.
            </p>
            <p>
                Bruno represents a discomfiting reminder that Guy’s upwardly mobile desires can be problematic. You have a party of socialites and Bruno shows up. Bruno shows up at several respectable places (his family has social standing), sometimes as an amiable conversationalist, other times as a public embarrassment. He’s clever and witty, especially to people who cannot admit that high society could have such an ignoble vessel spouting out things like:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    How do you do, sir? I’d like to talk with you sometime, sir, and tell you about my idea for harnessing the life force. It’ll make atomic power look like the horse and buggy. I’m already developing my faculty for seeing millions of miles. And Senator: can you imagine being able to smell a flower – on the planet Mars?
                </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                This “stranger” is, indeed, quite strange. Any attempt to rein in Bruno is met with his contempt. His psychological side, an infantile emotional complex – over-mothered and under-fathered – reflects the type of man Guy may have been when he was courting Miriam. Bruno wants Guy to destroy his (their) superego. Then the two can live together in psychologically wedded bliss, unrestrained by society’s rules.
